Data Science and Analysis Portfolio


# [Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) of Energy Data: Project Overview](https://github.com/OGsiji/machine-learning-projects-codes/blob/master/EDA-On-Energy_Data.ipynb)
- The major focus of this project was to use EDA to extract meaning/information from data using plots and report important insights about data
- The data fuel quality data from Fedral Energy Regulation Commission which is provided by the United States Energy Information Administration. 
- This part is more about data analysis and fuel usage intelligence.
- I also gave interesting insights based on my analysis
- I suggested data preprocessing, feauture selection and Feauture Engineering options to Apply our Machine Learning algorithims succesfully.


# [Project 2:  Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) of MPG Data Set : Project Overview](https://github.com/OGsiji/machine-learning-projects-codes/blob/master/mercedes-benz-data-exploration.ipynb)
- This part consists of summary statistics of data but the major focus will be on EDA where we extract meaning/information 
- This will be done using plots to report important insights about the data.
- This part is more about **data analysis** and **business intelligence(BI)**.
- The data we are using for EDA is the [auto mpg](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/auto+mpg) dataset taken from UCI repository. 
- I also gave interesting insights based on my analysis
- I suggested data preprocessing, feauture selection and Feauture Engineering options to Apply our Machine Learning algorithims succesfully.
- In the other parts I plan exploring Statitical Analysis and Predictive Modelling

# [Project 3: Data-cleaning-challenge-handling-missing-values : Project Overview](https://github.com/OGsiji/machine-learning-projects-codes/blob/master/data-cleaning-challenge-handling-missing-values.ipynb)
- This part contains the cleaning of an nfl play data set
- I performed different filling methods based on the size and the number of the missing values
- I also drop the missing values and used different filling techniques for them
- I justified the various filling methods by testing the data-set
