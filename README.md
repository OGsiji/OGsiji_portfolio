#[Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) of Energy Data: Project Overview](https://github.com/OGsiji/machine-learning-projects-codes/blob/master/EDA-On-Energy_Data.ipynb)
- The major focus of this project was to use EDA to extract meaning/information from data using plots and report important insights about data
- The data fuel quality data from Fedral Energy Regulation Commission which is provided by the United States Energy Information Administration. 
- This part is more about data analysis and fuel usage intelligence(BI).
- I also gave interesting insights based on my analysis
- I suggested data preprocessing, feauture selection and Feauture Engineering options to Apply our Machine Learning algorithims succesfully.
